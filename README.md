# MoodyFoody
MoodyFoody is a food locator app that allows you to find restaurants near you, using various filters such as:
- Location
- Price Range
- Distance
- Genre
- Restaurant Type
- When you would like to go
<br />
<br />
## Motivation
We wanted to create an app that could be used to solve a problem in people's daily lives. Finding a good restaurant to go to can often take way more time than it should, so we created MoodyFoody to streamline that process.
<br />
<br />
## How do we do it?
MoodyFoody utilizes both the Google Maps and Yelp APIs to pull location data, restaurant ratings, and restaurant reviews.
<br />
<br />
## Tech/framework used
Built with:
- Materialize
- Google Maps API
- Yelp API
<br />
